            Hi, I'm Matt! I'm a junior web developer with a passion for fashion (mostly denim), smashin' (SSB 4 is superior to Melee, don't @ me), and crashin' (usually by 9:30pm). Thanks for checking out my page to learn a little more about me!

            Did you know that WIC Entertainment produced a Donkey Kong Country TV show in 1996 that ran for 40 episodes? Did you also know that each episode featured 2 original songs performed by the voice cast? If you thought these facts were fun, feel free to contact me</a>!
